# AI Assignment: Footfall Counter using Computer Vision

[cite_start]This project is a computer vision-based system that counts the number of people entering and exiting through a specific area in a video, fulfilling the requirements of the AI Assignment[cite: 3, 4].

The system uses the YOLOv8 object detection model with built-in tracking to detect and follow individuals. It establishes a virtual line and counts people as they cross it, distinguishing between "IN" (left-to-right) and "OUT" (right-to-left) movements.

## 🚀 Features

* [cite_start]**Person Detection**: Uses the `YOLOv8n` model to detect people in each frame[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]**Object Tracking**: Employs YOLO's built-in tracker (ByteTrack) to assign and maintain a unique ID for each person, even through some occlusions[cite: 20, 48].
* **Counting Logic**: Defines a dynamic, vertical line in the center of the frame. [cite_start]It counts a person *once* when their centroid crosses this line[cite: 21, 22].
* [cite_start]**Visualization**: Draws bounding boxes, track IDs, and total "IN" / "OUT" counts on the video in real-time.
* **Video Output**: Saves the processed video with all visualizations to an `output.mp4` file.
* [cite_start]**Bonus: Real-time Webcam (Bonus)**: Can be configured to run on a live webcam feed[cite: 47].
* [cite_start]**Bonus: Trajectory Paths (Bonus)**: Draws a "tail" behind each person to visualize their path[cite: 49].

##  Video Source

[cite_start]The primary video source used for development is the `people-detection.mp4` video from the [Intel IoT DevKit Sample Videos](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos) repository[cite: 36].

The script can also be set to use a live webcam feed by changing the `VIDEO_SOURCE` constant.

##  Counting Logic Explained

The counting logic is based on tracking the centroid (center point) of each person:

1.  **Define Line**: A vertical line is dynamically placed in the exact center of the video frame.
2.  **Track History**: The script stores a history of the `(x, y)` centroid for each tracked `ID`.
3.  **Check Crossing**: In each frame, the script checks if a person's *current* `x` coordinate has crossed the line relative to their *previous* `x` coordinate.
    * **IN**: If `previous_x < line_x` and `current_x >= line_x`, the `IN` counter increases.
    * **OUT**: If `previous_x > line_x` and `current_x <= line_x`, the `OUT` counter increases.
4.  **Prevent Double Counts**: A `set` (named `counted_ids`) stores the ID of every person who has already crossed the line, ensuring they are only counted once.

## 🛠️ Dependencies and Setup

[cite_start]This project requires **Python 3.8 or newer**[cite: 58].

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate on Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate on macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Footfall-Counter
